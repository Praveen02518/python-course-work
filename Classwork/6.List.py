#1.Basic Features of Lists
# Ordered: Lists maintain the order of elements.
# Mutable: Elements can be modified after creation.
# Indexed: Elements can be accessed using an index (starting from 0).
# Allow Duplicates: Lists can contain duplicate values.
# Heterogeneous: Lists can contain different data types (e.g., int, str, float, etc.).
# Dynamic: Size is not fixed; elements can be added or removed dynamically.
